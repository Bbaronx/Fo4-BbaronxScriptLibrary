# Fo4-BbaronxScriptLibrary
A public script library designed to keep from having to write small simple scripts for basic functions on most mods you make

Distributed under the Unlicense, and I'm ASKING that if you redistribute you either put it in a .ba2, or you change the name/header space just so you don't conflict with other versions. I mean, you're not legally bound to do that though, it'd just make life easier on people that don't know the answer to the question *should I allow this to overwrite files?* if they already have the scripts installed.

Included Scripts:
Bbaronx_AddPerks
Bbaronx_AddSpellsOnStart
Bbaronx_PlayTextbox
Bbaronx_AddMiscItemsOnStart
Bbaronx_IncrementGlobals
Bbaronx_PlayNotification
Bbaronx_AddAnyOnStart
